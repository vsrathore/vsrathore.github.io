How to use:
1: Only xls is allowed format.
2: Each sheet must have two identifier row.
  i)  On which column we need filter
  ii) column name we need to show in our filter table.

Eg:
      | Column1 | | Column2 | | Column3 | | Column4 | | Column5 | | Column6 | | Column7 | | Column8 |
Row1  |    a    | |         | |    a    | |   a     | |   a     | |         | |    a    | |         |
Row2  |   name  | | address | |   range | |  rank   | |  dob    | |         | |   phone | |  email  |
Row3  |   Name1 | | add1    | |    re1  | |   rt    | | Date_B  | |   sads  | | Contact | |   E_ID  |
